# Dispenser

You can find the \[V3 branch here](TODO: ...). Dispenser is designed to be used by other Discord servers, so I don't recommend self-hosting, unless you really have a need to.

## How to use

The Node and Bun versions don't function yet, so use Deno. Dispenser will be remain Deno-oriented. It's better to make a systemd service for it, rather using a shell script, but ince there are no guides on how to do that now, try running `start.sh`.

## How to test

The test cases haven't been written yet, but they will be in `test/` and be written for Deno and Bun.
