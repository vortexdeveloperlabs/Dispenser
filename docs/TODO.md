# TODOs

- [ ] Add message splitting to Responder.respond (see what I said as a comment
      in PR #3)
- [ ] Force the user to accept the TOS and PP before they can use any
      interaction. There will be three buttons on an embed
      `Read Privacy Policy`, `Read Terms of Service`, and `Accept`. When you
      click on the former buttons it will display those respective documents.
